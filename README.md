I work at Allen Institute, where I apply machine learning models to segment cells in brain tissue images, classify cell types,
and predict anatomical brain regions from sequencing data.

My goal is to build these models, creating methods that are not just passive tools, but scalable, generalizable, and insightful collaborators for scientists.
My research interests lie in multimodal representation learning and interpretable machine learning, which I see as essential foundations for developing models that reason across heterogeneous data modalities and accelerate scientific discovery.
